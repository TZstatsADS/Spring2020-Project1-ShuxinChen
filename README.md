### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Rock Music vs. Metal Music 
+ This project is conducted by Shuxin Chen

+ Project summary: In this project, I compared and contrasted two misic genres, rock and metal. Sometimes, people classify the two kinds of music as one. Here, I analyzed their similarities and differences from the aspects of composition of lyrics, words used frequently and emotions expressed. It turned out that rock songs contain more abundant stem words and express positive emotion by romantic lyrics. While metal songs prefer repeating stem words to form lyrics and they use darker words to show relatively negative emotions.
